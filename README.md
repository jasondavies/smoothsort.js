Smoothsort.js
=============

This is a JavaScript implementation of Dikstra's [smoothsort][1].  If the input
is already sorted to some degree, it "smoothly" approaches O(n) running time.
It is an in-place algorithm, and only requires O(1) auxiliary storage space.

The implementation is largely based on the Java code in the Wikipedia article.
